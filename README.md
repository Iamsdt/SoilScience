# SoilScience
It a dictionary all that contain soil related word. But it is not a complete app. It contains only 140 word.
But It is a good example project for beginners.

This is a full project as I told earlier. It's only lacking is it's database is not complete. So it not for the user,
it for the beginner level developer.
